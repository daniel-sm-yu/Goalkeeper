Big goals are often accomplished through smaller goals. Breaking long-term goals down into daily goals makes them easier to focus on. Goalkeeper enables users to set daily goals with a target duration and displays them as progress bars. Instead of either done or not done, it helps to see the progress as the goal is being completed. Goalkeeper leverages gamification to assign point values based on duration while granting bonus points if a goal is completed. 

Pressing a goal activates it and its progress bar will begin to fill up. The active goal will have a glowing background. Swiping a goal to the left will reveal the edit and delete options. Goals also have a _Repeat Daily_ attribute. At the end of every day, points are calculated and assigned to the user. Goals that should _Repeat Daily_ are reset while other goals are deleted.

Goalkeeper was built with React Native in TypeScript and uses Mobx State Tree for state management.
